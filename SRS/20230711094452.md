# 1. Introduction
## 1.1 Purpose

The purpose of this document is to provide a comprehensive and detailed specification for the development of an application aimed at assisting medical professionals in the accurate diagnosis of acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL).

Acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) is a type of cancer that affects the blood and bone marrow. It is the most common type of cancer in children, and accounts for about 30% of all childhood cancers. ALL is caused by a mutation in the DNA of a white blood cell, which causes the cell to grow and divide uncontrollably.

The diagnosis of ALL is typically made by a combination of blood tests and bone marrow biopsies. However, these tests can be difficult to interpret, and there is a risk of false positives and false negatives.

This software application is designed to help improve the diagnosis of ALL by using convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to **analyze pathological images of individual cells**. CNNs are a type of machine learning algorithm that are specifically designed for image recognition. They have been shown to be very effective at identifying patterns in images, and they have been used to diagnose a variety of diseases, including cancer.
